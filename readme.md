# Facemask Detection

- Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV. We will also see how to apply this on a Live Video Camera. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks.

##  Tech/framework used
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone [https://github.com/Cyvid7-Darus10/Face-Mask-Detection/tree/master](https://github.com/Cyvid7-Darus10/Face-Mask-Detection/tree/master)
```

2. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
##
> The face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.). 

> This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. 

> This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
